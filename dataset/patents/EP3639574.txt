1. A communication apparatus (110) comprising:
circuitry configured to compute, using a temporal key and a number as input of a hash function, a hash value to be used by a station, STA (120-140), to determine whether or not a wake-up radio, WUR, frame (230) containing the hash value is authentic, and
a transmitter configured to transmit, to the STA (120-140), the WUR frame (230) containing the hash value,
characterized in that
the hash value is computed using a transmitter address, TA, of the communication apparatus as an input of the hash function, and
the number is a part of time synchronization function, TSF, timer.

2. The communication apparatus (110) according to Claim 1,
wherein the temporal key is a WUR Temporal Key, and the circuitry uses the WUR Temporal Key to compute the hash value for protecting the WUR frame which is an individually addressed WUR frame (230).

3. The communication apparatus (110) according to Claim 1,
wherein the temporal key is a WUR integrity group Temporal Key, and the circuitry uses the WUR integrity group Temporal Key to compute the hash value for protecting the WUR frame (230) which is a broadcast WUR frame or a group addressed WUR frame.

4. The communication apparatus (110) according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
wherein the hash value is contained in a frame check sequence, FCS, field of the WUR frame.

5. The communication apparatus (110) according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
wherein the hash value is computed from an ID field of the WUR frame (230).

6. The communication apparatus (110) according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
wherein the number is incremented by one for each of transmissions of the WUR frame (230) using the temporal key.

7. The communication apparatus (110) according to Claim 6,
wherein the number is indicated by a subfield of the WUR frame.

8. A communication method implemented by a communication apparatus (110), the communication method comprising:
computing, using a temporal key and a number as input of a hash function, a hash value to be used by a station, STA (120-140), to determine whether or not a wake-up radio, WUR, frame (230) containing the hash value is authentic; and
transmitting, to the STA (120-140), the WUR frame (230) containing the hash value, and
characterized in that
the hash value is computed using a transmitter address, TA, of the communication apparatus as an input of the hash function, and
the number is a part of time synchronization function, TSF, timer.

9. The communication method according to Claim 9,
wherein the temporal key is a WUR Temporal Key, and the WUR Temporal Key is used to compute the hash value for protecting the WUR frame which is an individually addressed WUR frame (230).

10. The communication method according to Claim 9,
wherein the temporal key is a WUR integrity group Temporal Key, and the WUR integrity group Temporal Key is used to compute the hash value for protecting the WUR frame (230) which is a broadcast WUR frame or a group addressed WUR frame.
